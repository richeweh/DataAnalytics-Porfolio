1. **Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?**
    
    **No. The number of reviews posted does not correlate with having more fans. For example, there are people like `Mimi` who have more reviews (968) than `Amy` (609) but have fewer fans (497 vs 503). Similarly, `William` has more reviews (1215) but fewer fans (126) compared to `Cat` who has 377 reviews and 133 fans. Therefore, there is no noticeable correlation between having more reviews and having more fans.**

## Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. **Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.**

**SQL code used for analysis:**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE 
    WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 Stars'
    WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 Stars'
    END AS ratings,
           b.name,
           c.category, 
           b.stars, 
           h.hours
FROM business b
JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE b.city = 'Las Vegas' --
AND c.category = 'Restaurants'
--AND (stars BETWEEN 
ORDER BY stars ASC
```

**Results**

**i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?**

**I chose Las Vegas as my city, and the `'Restaurants'` as the category. Based on these criteria, there is a distribution of hours between the restaurants and the rating.
The only business `(Wingstop)` which qualifies within the 2-3 ratings group, operate between 11:00am - 12:00am (midnight) or 13 hours. While in the 4-5 ratings group the two restaurants `(Jacques Cafe and Big Wong Restaurant)` operate between 11:00am - 8pm and 10:00am - 11:00pm respectively. The overall range within the data set is as follows:**

```markdown
MIN hour: 8am
MAX hour: 12am (midnight)
AVG hours: 11.13 hours
```

---

**ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?**

**Yes, each restaurant group has a different number of reviews. Wingstop has 123, Jacques Cafe has 168 and Big Wong has 768.**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE 
    WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 Stars'
    WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 Stars'
    END AS ratings,
           b.name,
           c.category, 
           b.stars,
           b.review_count,
           h.hours

JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id

AND c.category = 'Restaurants'
--AND (stars BETWEEN

**iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.**

**What stood out to me the most is that restaurants in this particular location `(Las Vegas)` usually operate from pre-noon (12pm) and midnight. Excluding Sunday for `Jacques Cafe`, all restaurants involve operate for 9-13 hours on throughout the week (weekdays and weekends included). Lastly, my final inferrence is that the operational cut-off time is Midnight. No restaurant business in `Las Vegas` in open after midnight.**  

1. **Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.**
    
    **i. Difference 1:** 
    **`â€˜Openâ€™` businesses (3.67) have a slightly higher average number of stars  than `â€˜Closedâ€™` businesses (3.52). And `â€˜Openâ€™` businesses (31.75) also have much average number of reviews compared to `â€˜Closedâ€™` businesses (23.19).**
    

**ii. Difference 2:** 

**`â€˜Openâ€™` businesses have at least 5x the number reviews (3873) than `â€˜Closedâ€™` business (700)**

**SQL code used for analysis:**

```sql
SELECT
      CASE WHEN is_open = 1 THEN  'Open' ELSE 'Closed' END AS Status, 
      AVG(stars), AVG(review_count),
      MIN(stars), MAX(stars),
      MIN(review_count), MAX(review_count), 
      stars, 
      review_count

GROUP BY 1

1. **For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.**

**Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:**

**i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:**

**I'll perform a basic sentiment analysis based on the review text for each business and then group is by city (to simplify the results). I used CASE conditions to count the number of 'Good' vs 'Bad' types of words such as "great", "nasty", "perfect" etc. I then grouped these by city to assign each the city a sentiment score based on the logic above.**

**ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:**

**I chose this analysis because I was inspired by an earlier exercise in this same course. I wanted to expand the analysis to include more words and logic. I also wanted to gauge what customers were saying in the reviews. In order to perform this analysis, I needed the `Business` and `Reviews (text)` data.**

**iii. Output of your finished dataset:**
